# Wrong Syntax
# shivam project = 34
# Rules for creating syntax
# 1. Variable should start with a letter or an underscore
# 2. Variable cannot start with a number
# 3. It can only cotain alpha-numeric characters
# 4. Variable names are case sensitive i.e. Shivam and shivam are two different variables

# typeA = type(a)
# typeB = type(b)
# print(typeA)
e = "31"
e = 3.14
print(type(e))
print(e+2)
